/*
In a technical interview, you've been given an array of numbers and you need to find a pair of numbers that are equal to the given target value. 
Numbers can be either positive, negative, or both. Can you design an algorithm that works in O(n)â€”linear time or greater?

let sequence = [8, 10, 2, 9, 7, 5]
let results = pairValues(sum: 11) = //returns (9, 2)

  Solution - Using Set for memoization.

let dp = new Set();
let a = [8,10,2,9,7,5];
let sum = 7;
for(let n of a){
    let diff = sum - n;
    if(dp.has(diff)){
        console.log(diff,n);
        break;
    }else{
        dp.add(n);
    }
